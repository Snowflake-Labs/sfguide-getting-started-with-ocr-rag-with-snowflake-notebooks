# Getting Started with OCR and RAG with Snowflake Notebooks

## Overview

In this guide, you'll learn how to build an end-to-end application that extracts text from images and makes it searchable using Large Language Models (LLMs). The application combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR), vector embeddings, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to create an intelligent document assistant.

## Step-By-Step Guide
